<a id="about"></a>
<h3><span class="und">'Su</span>p, I'm Jamie</h3>
<p>
I have been hand coding sites since the age of 13, when I became frustrated with Geocities Pagebuilder and found out that
I could position every pixel <i>however I wanted</i> using HTML and CSS. Armed with Notepad and Paint on a clunky Windows 95 computer,
my fascination with web design and development began...
</p>
<p>
Although responsive design and Javascript are more my cup of tea these days, I still remember the days of slicing images in Paint and
putting everything together by building complex tables with enough colspans and rowspans to get the job done. I have become vastly interested
in the development of the web, where information meets interaction, where the possibilities are endless.
</p>
<p>
Come with me on a journey through time and space, and view some of my projects below...

<h3><span class="und">Fr</span>ont End Developer</h3>
<a id="devl"></a>
	<p>
	Although still learning Javascript and jQuery, I am excited about the potential for future projects and the added functionality for
	front-end design.
	</p>
<img src="work/todo.png" alt="Get Shit Done" class="work" />
	<h4><span class="und">Get Shit Done</span></h4>
	<p>
	This is an example of what can be achived with a little Javascript, jQuery and a dash of fully responsive HTML &amp; CSS.
	</p>
	<p>
	<em>Get Shit Done</em> is a little in-browser program that allows you to enter
	to-dos, remove when complete, and move them around to keep note of future and most important tasks.

<img src="work/solar.jpg" alt="Solar Reality Landing Page" class="work" />
		<h4><span class="und">Landing Page</span></h4>
		<p>
		An earlier project - a landing page template for a fictitious American-based energy supplier. All landing pages have one key action, the focus of this one being to persuade
		the user to try a free consultation.
		</p>
		<p><em>Solar reality</em> is fully responsive, and uses HTML5 &amp; CSS, with form validation written in Javascript.

	Although front end development is my passion, I still enjoy graphic design, particularly when designing for use on web-based platforms.

<img src="work/stjohns.png" alt="St John Youth - Blindfold Challenge" class="work" />
	<h4><span class="und">St John Youth - Blindfold Challenge</span></h4>
		<p>
	St John Youth are doing a blindfold challenge using social media - specifically the web platform <a href="http://givealittle.co.nz">Give a 		Little</a>,
	a site that allows people to fundraise for specific events and projects.
	The brief for the project was to make branding and media to be used across the different projects. It had to align with current
	<a href="https://youth.stjohn.org.nz/">St John Youth</a> branding, be fun, bright and easily communicated.
	<p>
	<p>
	"The Blindfold Challenge" is a challenge meant to help raise money for the Eye Hospital in Jerusalem, the original home of the
	knights of St John. They treat thousands of people each year with various forms of blindness, and other eye conditions. One of their
	aims is to treat people regardless of age, gender, race, or religion.
	</p>
	<p>
	The fundraising project is aimed at youth members, the goal is to convince them to relate and empathize with those with
	seeing disabilities, to provide solidarity, and to raise awareness of St John Youth and the work of the eye hospital in Jerusalem.
